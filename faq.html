                <p class="t_bold">INDEMNIFICATION</p>
                <p class="pb_20">You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Site or any other third party platform such as social media that may interact with the Site) agree to defend (at Riley Rose��s request), indemnify and hold Riley Rose harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on the Site or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Site; (ii) your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or (v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Riley Rose in the defense of any claim. Riley Rose reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of Riley Rose.</p>

                <p class="t_bold">ARBITRATION</p>
                <p class="pb_10">Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Riley Rose's intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); or (2) violations of  the ��Content Submission�� provision above, ("<strong>Excluded Disputes</strong>"), you agree that all disputes between you and Riley Rose (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with Riley Rose, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Site, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Riley Rose hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules, and as long as such matter is only pending in that court. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Riley Rose will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Riley Rose is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Riley Rose or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.</p>

                <p class="pb_20">If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Riley Rose's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition. Riley Rose reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.
